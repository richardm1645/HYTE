              Growing up, my parents instilled an
              unbreakable confidence within me and
              taught me the work ethic needed to reach
              my goals. It wasnâ€™t until high school that I
              was made aware of the notorious reputation
              of rigorous careers like engineering and tech.
              The confidence that my parents had built
              within me made me into a strong student and
              an advocate for youth to pursue STEM.
              HYTE is a vessel for me to spread that
              confidence to more students, in hopes of
              encouraging them to pursue a career in tech.
