              Growing up, my parents instilled an
              unbreakable confidence within me and
              taught me the work ethic needed to reach
              my goals. It wasnâ€™t until high school that I
              was made aware of the notorious reputation
              of rigorous careers like engineering and tech.
              The confidence that my parents had built
              within me made me into a strong student and
              an advocate for youth to pursue STEM.
              HYTE is a vessel for me to spread that
              confidence to more students, in hopes of
              encouraging them to pursue a career in tech.

          <p className="why-desc">
            Since the pandemic, students' personal portfolios struggle to stand out to admissions, as they have
            become repetitive and do not stand out anymore. Through HYTE, students are demonstrating leadership,
            initiative, the starting and completing of a technical project, as well as the chance to win a scholarship or
            other awards for our exceptional students. These are all characteristics that university's look for when
            assessing personal portfolios and this will help your application stand out.
